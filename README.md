# 🔐 Caesar Cipher in Python

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and most famous encryption techniques.  
This project lets you **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a given key.

---

## ✨ Features
- Encrypt (`e`) or decrypt (`d`) any lowercase message.
- Supports custom shift keys.
- Preserves spaces and punctuation marks.
- Interactive loop so you can try multiple messages in one run.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user chooses whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt**.  
2. The user enters a **message**.  
3. The user provides a **shift key** (number of letters to shift).  
4. The program outputs the result.

## 📌 Example
```bash
Enter 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e
Enter the message: hello world
Enter the shift key: 3
